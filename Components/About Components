Components: 
  . Building blocks, 
  . Represents a part of UI, 
  . Reusable with different properties e.g.: one sideNav for left and right, 
  . One component can contain another component e.g.: App component contain other components
  . Components are placed inside JS file (e.g.: App Component is placed in App.js file)

Two types of component
    1.	Functional: Stateless, return HTML tag
          . Accepts input of properties and return HTML that describes UI.
          . Specify as custom HTML tag.
          . If there is no content use closing tag.
          . Use arrow function
    2.	Class: Statefull, ES6 classes which extends Component class, must contain Render method which will return HTML.
          . Can maintain private internal state.
          . 2 imports - react and component class from react.
          . Must extend from component class.
          . Implement render method which will return null or HTML.
