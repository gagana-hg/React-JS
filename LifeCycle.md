__What are React lifecycle methods?__    
  * Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events.
  * Life Cycle methods are only supported in Class components.    

Below are the 4 phases     
  1. Mounting : When an instance of component is being created and inserted into DOM.    
  2. Updating : When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
  3. Unmounting : When a component is being removed from DOM. 
  4. error handling : When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
