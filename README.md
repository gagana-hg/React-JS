React JS

About React 
1.	Developed by Facebook.
2.	React is not a framework it's an open source library.
3.	Component Based Architecture - Build small encapsulated components, which can then be composed to make complex UIs. 
4.	React allows us to create reusable components.
5.	React is declarative - Tell react what we want and react will build it UI for you.
 e.g.: If we ask an artist to create a landscape, He will create without asking questions at the same time if we ask a kid to draw a landscape, we need to guide the child. 
You don't control the flow react will do it for you.
